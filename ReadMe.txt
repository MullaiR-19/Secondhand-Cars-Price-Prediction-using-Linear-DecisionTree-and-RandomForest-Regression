##Secondhand cars price prediction using Linear DecisionTree and RandomForest Regression

Predicting the price of secondhand cars can be a challenging task due to the numerous factors that affect the price, such as the age, mileage, condition, and location of the car. 
Machine learning algorithms can be used to predict the price of secondhand cars accurately. 
In this project, we use three different regression algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression to predict the price of secondhand cars.

We collected the dataset from various sources, including online car sales platforms and dealerships. 
The dataset consists of 10,000 instances, each representing a different car, and 12 features, such as the make and model of the car, the year of production, and the mileage. 
We preprocess the data by handling missing values and converting categorical variables to numerical values.

We then train and evaluate each of the three algorithms using k-fold cross-validation. We also perform hyperparameter tuning to improve the performance of each algorithm. 
We compare the performance of each algorithm in terms of mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared score.

Linear Regression algorithm assumes a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables, while Decision Tree Regression builds a tree structure to model 
the relationship between the variables. Random Forest Regression algorithm combines multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy of the model.

The results show that Random Forest Regression algorithm outperformed both Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regression in predicting the price of secondhand cars. 
However, all three algorithms performed reasonably well, and further optimization could lead to better results. The code and results of this project can be found on GitHub.
